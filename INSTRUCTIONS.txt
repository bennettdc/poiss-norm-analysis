# General instructions to run/use this program

Requirements:
  R installed
  JAGS installed
  rjags package installed in R

To run the analysis as-is, simply run master.r:
	>	setwd("<folder path for master.r>")
	>	source('master.r')

To try running the same process but with different parameters, you can adjust the variables at the beginning of master.r

To speed up the process, reduce the number of samples, number of burn-in cycles, and number of data points
To increase accuracy, increase them, instead

Run time is essentially O(amount of data * (number of adaptive cycles + number of burn-cycles + number of samples))

Editing prior variables will primarily change the number of burn-in cycles that is appropriate, unless the data set is very small.
